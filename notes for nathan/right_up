I am using this service for data visualization. https://iot.app.initialstate.com it is a payed service, 100$ a year or 8$ a month





These are the Python library i used.

    import Adafruit_DHT
    import psutil
    import time
    import sys
    from ISStreamer.Streamer import Streamer
    from subprocess import PIPE, Popen





This is the components that i will need. 

    Raspberry Pi 
    Micro SD card 
    Raspberry Pi power supply 
    DHT22 Temperature/Humidity Sensor 





Here is a estimate of how much it will cost to make. 

10  355.69$

20  827.8$

30  1,234.2$

40  1,844.6$

50  2,057$
